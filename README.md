Proxy to block all that needs to be blocked to create a children safe browsing environment.

## Proxy? really?
There are two problems really:

* Children going to Internet and find nasty stuff
* People being unable to do much about it.

There are plenty of software out there to try to help on that safe browsing quest. My experience is that it works as long as children are children. Once they want to get out... they usually are more tech savy than the parents.

The idea is to build some system that it's transparent based on a Proxy and a DNS server, and no, this will not be me writing a DNS server or a proxy... I'm not that crazy!
